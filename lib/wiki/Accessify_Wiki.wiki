==Welcome to the Accessify Wiki==
The Web is an important place for you and me to learn, work, play and shop. Unfortunately, many sites place barriers in the way of those with disabilities - this is [http://accessibleculture.org/why-build-accessible-websites/ bad for the visitor and the site] . There are a number of [http://www.w3.org/WAI/ standardization, education and outreach] efforts on the Web to address this problem.

Accessify Wiki complements those efforts, by providing a way for anyone to [[Write fixes|create Accessibility "fixes"]] for a Web site.

It provides [[Users|tools for end-users]] to use those fixes during their normal browsing experience. And, it provides [[Build fix js?q=Fix:Google_search|tools to help site owners and developers]] use the fixes to improve their Web sites.


Working together to fix accessibility on the Web, one site at a time.

Help us [[Write fixes|author accessibility fixes for any site]] right here in this Wiki. We're developing some nifty ways to [[Users| deliver the fixes to end-users]] automatically as you browse the Web.
