==============

Working together to fix accessibility on the Web, one site at a time.


`/browser/` contains browser plugins, bookmarklet Javascript and user Javascript (Greasemonkey).

`/site/` contains the prototype site and web-service, currently mostly written in Python to be hosted on [ScraperWiki][scraper-py].
